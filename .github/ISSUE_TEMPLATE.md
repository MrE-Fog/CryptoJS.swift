## ⚠️ New project in development

The javascript library used to implement the cryptography in this project is no longer maintained and suffers severe performance limitations over the new WebCrypto API. A new modern library called [WebCrypto.swift](https://github.com/etienne-martin/WebCrypto.swift) is being developed. [WebCrypto.swift](https://github.com/etienne-martin/WebCrypto.swift) leverages the power of the WebCrypto API while keeping backwards compatibility with this project.

No new development will happen in this repository. Please submit only bugs, no new feature requests here.
If you want something to be implemented, please submit an issue in the
new repository:
